# Anima_Diffusion_XL
Anima Diffusion XL v1.0

We are to announce Anima Diffusion XL v1.0, which specifically targets the Webtoon industry. With the extensive experiences and knowledge on Large Multimodal Model, we have prepared for build a large multimodal model best suited for Webtoon image creation. To this end, we have collected and preprocessed more than 10 million anime and illustration images which are copyright free. With the support and donation by Google Cloud, we were able to train the Anima Diffusion XL v1.0 model. We not only preprocessed the images but only described the images with our own caption algorithm.
